# Budget-Application-Using-RESTful-API

A web application where users can budget their money by creating categories with specified monthly spending limits and adding individual purchases to those categories, effectively decreasing the amount of money they had available to spend with each purchase. Wrote a RESTful API for this application, which allows the displaying, adding, and removing of both categories and purchases to be done via simple HTTP GET, POST, and DELETE requests from the calling script. All of the purchases and categories data is transmitted in a JSON format to/from the server. This project involved the use of Python and the Flask web framework, as well as HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, JSON, and AJAJ/AJAX.
